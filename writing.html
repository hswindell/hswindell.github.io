			<li>"Approximating the Uniform Norm via Discrete Sampling" (REU 2023) (in-progress)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Short Notes</h3>
		<p>These are short notes on an assortment of topics. The content includes proofs, observations, and ideas for further theory. They are basically mathematical versions of GitHub's <a href="https://gist.github.com" target="_blank">gists</a>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"A Proof of Induction" (<a href="writing/induction-proof.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
