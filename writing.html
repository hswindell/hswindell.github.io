		<p>I have informally written on a number of topics in mathematics. You can find most of this writing below.</p>
		<p>If you notice any errors or have any suggestions or ideas you want to share, you can contact me using the information <a href="about.html">here</a>.</p>
		<h3>Research Write-Ups</h3>
		<p>These are write-ups from research projects that I have been involved with.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Approximating the Uniform Norm via Discrete Sampling" (REU 2023) (<a href="writing/reu-2023-write-up.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Short Notes</h3>
		<p>These are short notes on an assortment of topics. The content includes proofs, observations, and ideas for further theory. They are basically mathematical versions of GitHub's <a href="https://gist.github.com" target="_blank">gists</a>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"A Proof of Induction" (<a href="writing/induction-proof.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
			<li>"A Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus" (<a href="writing/ftc-proof.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
			<li>"Redundancy in the Axioms for a Topology" (<a href="writing/topology-axioms.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Longer Works</h3>
		<p>These are longer works that are more comprehensive than the short notes above. The content is usually pedagogical or acts as a reference.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"Notes on Measure Theory" (in-progress)
				<ul>
					<li>These notes focus on measure spaces, with integration as a tool and not the primary focus.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
