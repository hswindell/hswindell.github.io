		<p>Since the start of 2024, I have been organizing programs and events for undergraduates at UW-Madison who are interested in category theory and adjacent topics.</p>
		<p>During the spring of 2024, I ran a reading group and organized two talks. The reading group covered most of Tom Leinster's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09375" target="_blank"><i>Basic Category Theory</i></a>. The first talk was given by Jack Westbrook, a UW-Madison undergraduate, on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/abelian+category" target="_blank">abelian categories</a>. The second talk was given by me on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/point-free+topology" target="_blank">point-free topology</a>.</p>
		<p>Future potential talk subjects include <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/species" target="_blank">combinatorial species</a> and <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/sheaf" target="_blank">sheaves</a>.</p>
		<p>If you would like more information about these programs and events, feel free to contact me using the information <a href="about.html">here</a>.</p>
