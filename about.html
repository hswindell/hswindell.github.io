		<p>Hi! My name is Holden Swindell (any pronouns), and I'm an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison studying mathematics.</p>
		<p>My current mathematical focus is homotopy theory and category theory, but I am interested in a wide range of mathematical subject areas. These include homotopy type theory, geometric measure theory, and synthetic differential geometry. In the past, I have also participated in research in the areas of geometric group theory and approximation theory.</p>
		<p>In addition to my formal academic work, I have also been involved in several service and outreach projects for the mathematical community. I am currently the president of the <a href="https://win.wisc.edu/organization/mathclub" target="_blank">Math Club</a> at UW-Madison, where we host talks and hold social events for undergraduates interested in mathematics. I have also separately organized a reading group and talks for undergraduates interested in category theory, which you can find more about <a href="category-theory.html">here</a>.</p>
		<p>Besides mathematics, one of my biggest passions is education. This includes working directly with students as well as building large-scale strategies for improving classroom outcomes and addressing the culture and perception around learning mathematics. I have been a tutor at the <a href="https://math.wisc.edu/undergraduate/mlc" target="_blank">Math Learning Center</a> at UW-Madison for several years, and am currently a lead tutor. At the MLC, in addition to tutoring students, I supervise and help train tutors and develop plans and tools for better serving our undergraduate student population.</p>
		<p>I am a strong advocate for improving diversity and representation in mathematics. No one should have their identity be an obstacle to pursuing mathematics and making this a reality requires all of us to make an effort. As part of this, I am on the <a href="https://lgbtmath.org/People.html" target="_blank">Spectra outlist</a>.</p>
		<p>Outside of mathematics and education, one of my favorite pastimes is music! I've been playing music and looking for interesting and experimental music for most of my life.</p>
